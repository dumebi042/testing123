There are no predefined groups for this PLD. You are free to join any group, which you will work with for the entire day .

There is no lead speaker - just collaborate!
Your group can contain learners from other campuses - please use the auto generated video room to meet with them.
Here's what you'll do!

Your group will vote on questions you'd like to review then spend the morning working through them (starting at the lowest number that received a vote)
Continue to fix, modify, or complete other questions as a group until 3pm
Have fun! Your learner tutor or Staff will continue to check in and support discussion and understanding.
